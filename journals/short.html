            <h3>Room and Board</h3>
            <p>
                
                I arrived late at night the first week, left the same week, and returned the week after (in the morning), and was assigned a different yet similar room, so I was able to document the experience following the second week.<br><br> 
                
                It appears that college visitors (and other guests to the college) will stay at the Academic Exchange Center (which also doubled as an “on-campus hotel”), so the International Office put me up in one of those rooms there. <br><br>
                
                In all of the rooms I stayed in, there were 2 beds, a desk, a TV, and 2 loungers. Each room had a bathroom with a shower. I could not tell if the rooms had been vacuumed, and I found dust in many locations around the room. <br><br>
                
                I took photos in room A309, the first room I was assigned to. It was at the end of the building, right next to a fire escape with a door that wouldn’t close. Sometimes, I’d hear it creak open before hitting the wall (the door didn’t fit). It was starting to get annoying, so I ended up switching to room A307. <br><br>            
            </p>
            
            <h3>Classrooms</h3>
            <p>
                CIT’s international program took place 2 buildings away from my location. The International Office is also located in the same place. The classes I took were located on the same floor, the 2nd floor, of the Xuedao building. <br><br>
                
                Going up the stairs to the right was the director’s office, complete with 2 desks and a couch for guests. <br><br>
                Going down the hallway, there was a conference/exhibition room with stuffed bears (apparently promoting cooperation between CIT and multiple American universities) and posters. <br><br>
                
                To the left of the stairs were two ESL classrooms (aptly named ESL 1 and ESL 2, in the order closest to the stairs). Both classrooms are probably the same size, although ESL 1 had more desks and chairs, making it feel cozier. Meanwhile, there were 2 mini-Christmas trees in ESL 2, which I found particularly interesting. <br><br>
