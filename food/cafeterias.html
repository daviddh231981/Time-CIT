            <h1>Food from Cafeterias</h1>
            <p>
                phone still eats first, all food takeaway for consistency and comparison except for a few scenarios<br><br>

                Note that all cost less than 15 RMB (definitely far less than $2-3 USD).

                    There's few people in the cafeteria that early in the morning, so I was able to grab a few pictures of the first floor. Unfortunately, I couldn't get photos of the second floor as I couldn't find it until too late. Either way, here's a few. <br><br>

                    While i couldn't get photos of the North Cafeteria, ample seating and options were available. <br>

                <h3>Noodles in a Stone Pot</h3>
                <p>

                    This was by the recommendation of one of the class leaders, who told me to try this restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the South Cafeteria. Unfortunately, I didn't get the name of the shop or the name of this dish (it's a stone pot noodle with pork, I believe). It was flavorful and tasty. <br><br>
                    
                    This is one of those dishes that I would not recommend getting to-go, even though you may have seen me get many other options to-go.

                    For breakfast, I ordered a crispy wrap (I think it's a crepe) that was made in front of me. I thought it tasted good. <br><br>

                    There was a list of add-ons. Although this was advertised for a different dish, the options were the same as it's the same restaurant. <br><br>

                    For my first (and last) breakfast, I ate at the Staff Cafeteria, courtesy of the breakfast voucher provided by the CIT International Staff. <br><br>
                    
                    I opted for a veggie bun, a "meat bun" (I think it was pork, but not sure), and a fried egg. I also got a cup of hot soy milk. They had a large bottle of soy sauce that I also added. <br><br>
                    
                    Even with another fried egg, the entire plate (and cup) totaled 8 RMB, which is the amount provided on the voucher.<br><br>
